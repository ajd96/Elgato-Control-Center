# Elgato-Control-Center
Unofficial and open source alternative for the Elgato Control Center application for the Linux operating system

# Why was this open source project created

The open source project was created due to the lack of softare support Corsair is providing to the Linux community for their Elgato line up of products. During my research for alternative software solutions to solve this specific problem, a number of softare solutions are available on the internet (specifically Github) but are either not well maintained and supported or simply dont provide an easy to install and use solution within the Linux software ecosystem.

# Project Plans & Intentions

The project plans and intentions is to...

1. Design and develop and un-official Elgato contol center application for the Linux operating system

2. Release the application for the public use, using an easy to use installation solution such as FlatPak and or within the popular Linux package managers.
